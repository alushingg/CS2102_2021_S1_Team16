## What is PCS?
PCS is an application that allows pet owners to search for care takers for their pets for certain periods of time. 
After the transaction, they can leave a rating and review for the care taker. 

Care takers can either be part-timers or full-timers. 
They can specify the pets that they can take care of and specify their availability (if they are part-timers) or 
apply for leaves (if they are full-timers). They can view their past orders and the salary for the month. 

PCS administrators can create accounts for care takers and other administrators. Administrator accounts can be deleted 
except for the root account. Administrators will be able to view the summarised 
statistics for the year as well as for any month. 

## Accounts to try out
